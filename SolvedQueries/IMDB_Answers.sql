-- Table names as the highest no of rows with 23471, followed by genre table 14662.







-- Q2. Which columns in the movie table have null values?
-- Type your code below:

-- This query calculates the count of null values for various columns in the ‘movie’ table.



-- Now as you can see four columns of the movie table has null values. Let's look at the at the movies released each year.
